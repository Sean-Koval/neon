MCP is the emerging standard for AI agents to interact with external tools and data sources. This feature enables developers to monitor, debug, and optimize MCP tool usage in their agents.\n\n## Product Context\n\nNeon is an agent evaluation platform. As agents increasingly use MCP servers (file systems, databases, APIs), developers need visibility into:\n- Which MCP servers are being called and how often\n- Server health and latency characteristics\n- Error patterns and failure modes\n- The topology of MCP connections in multi-agent systems\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### 1. MCP Tracing Middleware (SDK)\n\nCreate middleware that automatically instruments MCP client calls.\n\n**Files to Create:**\n- `packages/sdk/src/tracing/mcp-middleware.ts` - Core middleware\n- `packages/sdk/src/tracing/mcp-types.ts` - MCP-specific trace types\n- `packages/neon-sdk-python/neon_sdk/tracing/mcp.py` - Python equivalent\n\n### 2. MCP Server Health Monitoring\n\nTrack aggregate health metrics per MCP server.\n\n**Files to Modify:**\n- `frontend/server/trpc/routers/analytics.ts` - Add MCP analytics queries\n- `frontend/lib/clickhouse.ts` - Add MCP aggregation queries\n\n### 3. MCP Topology Dashboard\n\nVisualize the MCP server topology and health.\n\n**Files to Create:**\n- `frontend/app/mcp/page.tsx` - MCP dashboard page\n- `frontend/components/mcp/server-topology.tsx` - Network graph visualization\n- `frontend/components/mcp/server-card.tsx` - Individual server health card\n- `frontend/components/mcp/tool-usage-table.tsx` - Tool usage breakdown\n- `frontend/hooks/use-mcp-health.ts` - Data fetching hook\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] SDK middleware auto-traces MCP calls without code changes to agent\n- [ ] MCPContext is populated for all MCP spans (serverId, toolId, transport)\n- [ ] Python SDK has equivalent tracing decorator\n- [ ] Dashboard shows all MCP servers with health indicators\n- [ ] Topology visualization renders server relationships\n- [ ] Latency percentiles are accurate (verified against raw data)\n- [ ] No mock data - all queries hit real ClickHouse\n- [ ] Performance: Dashboard loads in \u003c500ms for 10k spans\n- [ ] Tests: Unit tests for middleware, integration tests for queries\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Requires: MCPContext types (already in packages/shared/src/types/trace.ts)\n- Blocks: neon-3ae completion, neon-201, neon-bhk\n\n## Reference Files\n\n- `packages/shared/src/types/trace.ts` - MCPContext interface\n- `frontend/components/traces/span-detail.tsx` - MCPContextSection component\n- `frontend/app/analysis/page.tsx` - Example dashboard pattern","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"seanmkoval@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-03T10:00:00-05:00","created_by":"Claude","updated_at":"2026-02-03T22:30:48.445738204-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-03T22:30:48.445738204-05:00","close_reason":"Completed in PR #76","labels":["frontend","mcp","observability","phase-2","sdk"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"neon-mcp1","depends_on_id":"neon-3ae","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-03T10:00:00-05:00","created_by":"Claude"}]}

While existing scorers evaluate overall agent performance, this framework enables fine-grained evaluation of specific capabilities - critical for identifying which skills need improvement.\n\n## Product Context\n\nAgents use many skills (search, code editing, file operations, API calls). When an agent underperforms, developers need to know:\n- Which specific skills are failing?\n- Are skill parameters being set correctly?\n- Is the skill producing quality results?\n- How has skill performance changed over time?\n\nThis framework enables per-skill regression tracking and targeted improvement.\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n### 1. defineSkillEval API\n\nCreate a new SDK API for defining skill-specific evaluations.\n\n**Files to Create:**\n- `packages/sdk/src/evals/skill-eval.ts` - Core API\n- `packages/sdk/src/evals/skill-eval-types.ts` - Type definitions\n- `packages/neon-sdk-python/neon_sdk/evals/skill_eval.py` - Python equivalent\n\n### 2. Parameter Accuracy Scorers\n\nScorers that evaluate whether skill parameters are correct.\n\n**Files to Create:**\n- `packages/sdk/src/scorers/parameter-accuracy.ts` - Parameter scorers\n\n### 3. Result Quality Scorers\n\nScorers that evaluate the quality of skill outputs.\n\n**Files to Create:**\n- `packages/sdk/src/scorers/result-quality.ts` - Result scorers\n\n### 4.
