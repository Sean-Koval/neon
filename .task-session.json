    "Results are sent to Neon server when NEON_API_URL and NEON_API_KEY env vars are set",

    "Sends: suite name, test cases, scores, timing, metadata",
    "API client handles authentication with API key",
    "Configurable via environment variables (NEON_API_URL, NEON_API_KEY)",
    "Optional --no-sync flag to disable sending even when configured",
    "Clear success/failure message in CLI output (e.g., 'Results synced to Neon')",
